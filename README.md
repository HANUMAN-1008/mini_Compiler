# mini_Compiler
For educational purposes only.
Not a full-fledged compiler.
In this project, I have uploaded the 2 programs.
One for lexing and parsing compiler only.
The other is for a mini compiler capable of handling arithmatics and sigmoid function only.
The project is under development, and new features will be added.
