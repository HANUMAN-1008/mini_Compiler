# mini_Compiler_Project -By: SWATANTRA PRATAP SINGH(23115903)
For educational purposes only.

Not a full-fledged compiler.

In this project, I have uploaded 2 programs to build a compiler.

One is for lex and parse compiler only.

The other is for a mini compiler capable of handling arithmatics and sigmoid function only.

The projet is under development, and new features will be added.

# 1) FLEX_BISON COMPILER :
- A lexer and parser based compiler for my custom sigmoid function and arithematic equation.

- It uses only the first 3 phases of the compilation process (Lexical, Syntax and Semantic analysis).

- Thus, eliminating the intermediate code generation and assembler, the compilation is faster, but execution is slower as it parses during the runtime.


# 2) small_scale_Compiler (MY OWN SELF_MADE COMPILER) :
- A small-scale compiler limited to arithematic and sigmoid computing.

- However, it undergoes full stages of the compilation process.

- Hence, the compilation takes time, but the execution is very fast.
 
- The compiler is able to generate intermediate codes and uses the NASM assembler for assembly.

  IF YOU FIND ANY MISTAKES, FEEL FREE TO GUIDE.

    THANK YOU
